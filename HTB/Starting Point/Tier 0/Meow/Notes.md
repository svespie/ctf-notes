### Summary
The only TCP 23 appears to be open. Upon connection is a login page. Brute forcing / lucky guessing yields access to the system.

For some reason, I could not get hydra to work. There is a notable delay in the server response. Perhaps that was intentional to thwart brute force attempts?

### Lessons Learned
Wordlists are important. Even more important, is getting the damn tool to work correctly.

### Notes
The walkthrough solved this with some simple guessing:
* admin:
* administrator:
* root:

### Narrative
Default port scan:

`$ sudo nmap -n --open --reason 10.129.96.145`

Connecting to the telnet service provided a login interface after some time.

$ telnet 10.129.96.145

Tried a few basic passwords. No dice.

Deeper port scan found only TCP 23 open (UDP not checked yet). Service scan on TCP 23:

`$ sudo nmap -n -p 23 -sCV 10.129.96.145`

With no much else to go on, a list of common telnet credentials was identified from SecLists:

[SecLists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/telnet-betterdefaultpasslist.txt at master Â· danielmiessler/SecLists (github.com)](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials/telnet-betterdefaultpasslist.txt)

I put all of the telnet-* default creds file into a single wordlist.

Hydra...

`hydra -C creds.lst 10.129.168.164 telnet`

Setting creds2.lst to the three credentials in the walkthrough, tested the response. It seems to work OK.

Trying the bigger list again, this was an interesting result:

I suspect that it may have been moving too quickly. When performing this manually, once "root" is entered for the login the server grants access right away without need for a password.
